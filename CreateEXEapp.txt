To convert your Python program into an executable (.exe) file, you can use tools like PyInstaller or auto-py-to-exe. Here's a step-by-step guide using PyInstaller:

Using PyInstaller
Install PyInstaller: Open your command prompt or terminal and run:

pip install pyinstaller
Navigate to Your Script's Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory containing your Python script. For example:

cd path\to\your\script
Create the Executable: Run PyInstaller with your script. To create a single executable file, use the --onefile flag:

pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py
If your script has a GUI and you don't want a console window to appear, add the --noconsole flag:

pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole your_script.py
Find Your Executable: After PyInstaller finishes, you'll find your executable in the dist folder within your script's directory.
